# Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are encouraged and welcome; to keep things organised,
all bugs and requests should be opened in the github issues tab for the main project,
at [venturecraft/revisionable/issues](https://github.com/venturecraft/revisionable/issues).

Please submit all pull requests to the
[Color-PHP/develop](https://github.com/SpaceGazebo/Color-PHP/develop/tree/develop)
branch, so they can be tested before being merged into the master branch.
